Nitrogendioxide (NO2) is an important trace gas in the Earth's atmosphere. NO2 is a common product of combustion reactions and can be used to industrial activity. We prepared the figures in this repository using data collected by Tropomi, the spectrograph on board the Sentinal-5P satellite. In the coming weeks and months it will be important to continue monitoring how anothropogenic emissions respond to the Covid-19 pandemic.
